**VSB - Computer Graphics Fundamentals**
- The prerequisite is knowledge of programming in C++ at the level of the third year of undergraduate studies (project work, source code debugging, object-oriented programming, etc.).
- Knowledge of high school mathematics and mathematics taken in college in previous years (straight line, cosine function, matrix operations, etc.).
- The goal is to discuss the different parts of computer graphics (OpenGL) and their implementations. We will add the different parts into one project for clarity. The following parts will be discussed in turn:

1. Multiple models, shaders
2. Transformations
3. Camera and projection
4. Lighting models (Lambert, Phong, Blinn)
5. Normal matrix
6. Lights (spot, directional, reflector). multiple lights
7. Textures, skybox, skydom
8. Loading models (FBX)
9. Model identification, unproject
10. Movement along a line segment, Bézier cubics, Bézier curve along arcs
